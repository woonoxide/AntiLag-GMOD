# Antilag For gMod

i present to you. the antlag CFG, why? because i wanted to show off a basic antilag script i made and customized

WELL LETS GO!

the file consists in helpful gmod commands in a set, plus new commands!
# The New Commands.
1. al_help = antilag commands
2. antilag = run again the antilag

# Make it automatically run

You need:
1. Steam
2. An laggy gMod
3. Knowledge of the cfg folder and the "exec" console command
# Tutorial

Go to your local game files. and find the game folder, then go to your cfg folder and put the .cfg files there.

do the same for the lua files but in this case you put them in the (guess!!!)







LUA FOLDER!!!!!!!!!

go to steam then and go to your gmod propierties, then go to your launch options and type "exec antilag"

dont worry, you dont have to specifically close gmod, you can just type in console "exec antilag"

and the script should initialize.

# Notes

Now that the script has ran and made the commands, enjoy playing gmod without lag! (and with cheatz)

also theres sv_cheats 1 commands in epixis

n kinect utilities.

# UTILS:

Epixis, the custom cheat script, it lets you do many cool things.
